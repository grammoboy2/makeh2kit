{"name":"makeh2kit","tagline":"bash script to auto-generate .h2drumkit files","body":"# makeh2kit\r\n\r\nRunning makeh2kit with no arguments will scan the current directory for FLAC files and create a h2drumkit file named after the current directory. \r\nInstruments are named after the audio files minus their extension.\r\n\r\nAudio files can be treated as indiviual instruments or as instrument layers grouped either by sub-directory or by file name with numeric prefixes/suffixes indicating the layers.\r\nFor example, if the \"layer marker\" is set to \"prefix\":\r\n\r\n    00 kick1.flac\r\n    01 kick1.flac\r\n    02 kick1.flac\r\n    03 kick1.flac\r\n\r\nbecome layers of kick1, and\r\n\r\n    1_kick2.flac\r\n    2_kick2.flac\r\n    3_kick2.flac\r\n    4_kick2.flac\r\n\r\nbecome layers of kick2.\r\n\r\nHydrogen kits that \"map\" SFZ drum kits can also be created. The resulting kit won't contain any audio files and will instead trigger the MIDI note of each instrument in the SFZ kit. Once the kit is imported, connect Hydrogen's MIDI Out to the sampler's MIDI In.\r\n\r\nFile format (FLAC, WAV, AU, AIFF, or SFZ) can be specified using the -f option:\r\n\r\n    makeh2kit -f wav\r\n\r\nThe drum kit name, author, license, and info can also be entered on the command line. When supplying arguments to these options use single rather than double quotes to allow for use of special characters. In addition, HTML formatting tags may be entered when passing an argument to the info option:\r\n\r\n    makeh2kit -i '<p><b>Kit Name</b></p><p>Kit description</p>'\r\n\r\nOptions to reverse the sort order and to run the script in \"interactive mode\" are also available. To see the full list of options:\r\n\r\n    makeh2kit -h\r\n\r\nFor convenience of use, place the script in a directory included in the PATH environment variable (e.g. /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin).\r\n\r\nmakeh2kit requires bash v4 and gnu awk\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# Make h2drumkit\r\n\r\nThis is a Nautilus script to invoke makeh2kit. Any selected files will be passed as arguments to makeh2kit.\r\nThe script assumes that makeh2kit is installed in a directory included in the PATH environment variable (e.g. /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin) and that xterm is available.\r\n\r\nNear the top of the script are variables that may be modified if you need to specify the file path of makeh2kit or if you wish to use a terminal emulator other than xterm:\r\n\r\n    MAKEH2KIT_PATH=\"makeh2kit\"\r\n    TERMINAL_COMMAND=\"xterm -hold -title MakeH2drumkit -font 9x15 -e\"\r\n\r\nPlace the script in the Nautilus scripts directory, e.g. '~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts'. If Nautilus Scripts Manager is installed, place the script in '/usr/share/nautilus-scripts'.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# h2drumkit.desktop\r\n\r\nKDE service menu .desktop file to invoke h2drumkit. It assumes that h2drumkit is installed in a directory included in the PATH environment variable (e.g. /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin).\r\n\r\nPlace the .desktop file in one of the service menu directories, e.g. '/usr/share/services/ServiceMenus'.\r\n\r\nYou can find the location of all service directories like so:\r\n\r\n    kde4-config --path services\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
